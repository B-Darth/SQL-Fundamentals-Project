# SQL Basics Project

This repository contains the code and resources for my SQL basics project, aimed at beginners learning Structured Query Language (SQL). Whether you're just starting out with databases or looking to refresh your SQL skills, this project provides a comprehensive guide and practical exercises to help you understand the fundamentals of SQL.

## What's Included:

- **SQL Queries**: A collection of SQL scripts covering various topics such as data retrieval, data manipulation, table creation, and more.
  
- **Database Schema**: Detailed diagrams illustrating the structure of the sample database used in this project. Understanding the schema is crucial for comprehending how data is organized in a database.

Note:- The Schema Provided is create_mavenmovies.sql - Run it in order for your code to run
  
- **Exercises**: Hands-on exercises designed to reinforce the concepts learned throughout the project. Each exercise includes instructions and sample solutions to help you practice and master SQL.
  
- **Documentation**: Additional resources and documentation to aid in your learning journey, including SQL syntax guides, tips for optimization, and best practices.

Note:- The MySQL PROJECT.docx is provided by me to help with the overall explanation of each individual questions.
